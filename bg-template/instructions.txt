Instructions to create blue green analysis resources

Pre-requisites:

curl - check using curl --help
kubectl - check using kubectl --help
connection via kubeconfig to the cluster on which both stable and preview namespaces exist - check using kubectl get ns
deployments in both stable and preview namespaces with the full deployment of the application - check using kubectl -n <stablens> get deploy
a working iSD+argo installation in the same cluster, with prometheus, elasticsearch, kibana with ingress for isdui and isd argocd - check using kubectl -n <isdns> get po
a github repo, if you dont have a repo create a new one 
access to argocd ui check using kubectl -n <isdns> get ing argocd-ingress -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].host}' , use a browser to login to the ui
add the github repo  to argocd https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/private-repositories/ by going to 

Steps:
1. clone the github repo that was added to argocd to your local machine, run
git clone <repourl>
2. cd into the repo root directory, run
cd <mygithubreponame>
3. this will download the template files and scripts to create the required files which need to be committed
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gopaljayanthi/testArgoProj/main/bg-template/start.sh -o start.sh
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
4. git add -A
5. git commit -m "adding templates"
6. git push


7. for each application which needs analysis, please use only alphabets in lower case and numbers as arguments 
run
./create.sh <applicationName> <stable-ns> <preview-ns> <isd-ns>

applicationName = usersupplied name, with which a folder is created which needs to be later committed to a github repo, and an argocd application needs to be created
stable-ns: namespace where the stable version of application is running
preview-ns: namespace  where the version being previewed before promoting as stable exists
isd-ns: namespace hwre isd is installed

8. for each time you updated the preview namespace with new images
After the argocd application is created and syched to start an analysis, go to github repo, to the folder where the code was committed 
and run
./trigger-analysis.sh <namespace-where-the-roloout-was-deployed>
