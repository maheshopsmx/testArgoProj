Instructions to create blue green analysis resources in two different namespaces

section A. To download templates into a githubrepo

Pre-requisites:

curl - check using curl --help
kubectl - check using kubectl --help
connection via kubeconfig to the cluster on which both stable and preview namespaces exist - check using kubectl get ns
deployments in both stable and preview namespaces with the full deployment of the application - check using kubectl -n <stablens> get deploy and kubectl -n <previewns> get deploy
a working iSD+argo installation in the same cluster, with prometheus, elasticsearch, kibana with ingress for isdui and isd argocd - check using kubectl -n <isdns> get po
a github repo, create a new repo in github with a Readme.md file
access to argocd ui, check - kubectl -n <isdns> get ing argocd-ingress -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].host}' , use a browser to login to the ui
add the github repo  to argocd using instructions here https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/private-repositories/ 

Steps:
1. clone the github repo that was added to argocd to your local machine, run
git clone <repourl>
2. cd into the repo root directory, run
cd <mygithubreponame>
3. this will download the template files and scripts to create the required files which need to be committed
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gopaljayanthi/testArgoProj/main/bg-no-instrumentation-template/start.sh -o start.sh
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
===========================================================================================
section B. To create yaml files from templates and commit to github repo

Pre-requisites:
section A is completed
make sure all deployments are up and running in both stable and preview namespaces
please use only alphabets in lower case and numbers as arguments to create.sh that will be used in the following steps

Steps:
1. cd to the root folder of the repo created in Section A
2. for each application which needs analysis,  
run
chmod +x create.sh
./create.sh <applicationName> <stable-ns> <preview-ns> <isd-ns>
3. login to argocd host $argocdhost and look for application <applicationName> and sync it

applicationName = usersupplied name, with which a folder is created which will be later committed to this github repo, a namespace and an argocd application will be created
stable-ns: namespace where the stable version of application is running
preview-ns: namespace  where the version being previewed before promoting as stable exists
isd-ns: namespace where isd is installed
3. login to argocd url and look for application with name <applicationName> used in the previous command and sync the application
4. verify in argocd ui that a rollout, an analysis template, two services and a secret are created
5. review template.yaml in $mydirand remove any unneeded services from the services section then add/commit/push to github

===============================================================================================

section C. to trigger an analysis for each time you updated the preview namespace with new images

Pre-requisites:
Section B is completed
the argocd application is created and synched
all pods are up and running in both baseline and canary namespace
review template.yaml and remove any unneeded services from the services section and add/commit/push to github repo

1. go to github repo, to the folder where the code was committed
cd <reporoot>/<applicationName>
2.  run
chmod +x ./trigger-analysis.sh
./trigger-analysis.sh <applicationName>
3. login to argocd url and look for application with name <applicationName> used in the previous command and sync the application

===============================================================================================

section D. to automate the triggering process, a kubernetes job is created in the preview namespace, so that anytime the preview namespace is synched the job is triggered.

Pre-requisites:
Section B is completed
create a secret called github-secret in the preview namespace using kubectl -n <preview-ns> create secret generic github-secret --from-literal=username=<githubusername> --from-literal=password=<github-token>

steps:
1. get the template
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gopaljayanthi/testArgoProj/main/bg-template/trigger-job.yaml -o trigger-job.yaml
2. get the script
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gopaljayanthi/testArgoProj/main/bg-template/automate-trigger.sh -o automate-trigger.sh
chmod +x automate-trigger.sh
./automate-trigger.sh <applicationName> <preview-ns> <isd-ns>
3. commit the created file autotrigger.yaml into the github repo, in the same folder as where the preview application yamls are present
4. go to argocd ui and sync the preview application.
5. go to the argocd ui and sync the analysis application <applicationName> , check if an analysis is triggered
